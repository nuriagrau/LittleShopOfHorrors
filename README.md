## Project Overview
This project is designed to practice teamwork using Git while developing a Flower Shop Management System. The system will manage the catalog of products in a flower shop, including trees, flowers, and decorations, and will support different levels of data persistence (JSON file, MySQL, and MongoDB).

## Main Functionalities:
1. Create Flower Shop
2. Add Tree
3. Add Flower
4. Add Decoration
5. Print stock of all products (trees, flowers, and decorations)
6. Remove Tree
7. Remove Flower
8. Remove Decoration
9. Print stock quantities
10. Print total value of the shop's inventory
11. Create purchase tickets with multiple items
12. Show a list of past purchases
13. Display total earnings from all sales

## First: JSON File Persistence
In Level 1, the system will manage product data using a JSON file for persistence. The following requirements must be met:
* A flower shop has a name and an inventory of trees, flowers, and decorations.
* Each tree has a height.
* Each flower has a color.
* Each decoration has a material type (wood or plastic).
* All products have a price.
* The shop maintains an inventory of each product type.
* The shop keeps a record of the total value of its inventory.
* Implement a Ticket class to record purchases in a single list.

## Second: MySQL Persistence
In Level 2, switch the data persistence to use a MySQL database. Ensure all functionalities from Level 1 are supported.

## Third: MongoDB Persistence
In Level 3, switch the data persistence to use a MongoDB database. Ensure all functionalities from previous levels are supported.
